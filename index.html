        I have learnt a lot of things during the cause of this program. <br>
        CSS is very important in documents or web pages because it is used for  <b>styling</b> the web page, to make it look more <b>attractive</b>. For better understanding, we can say, <i>html is just the bone of a web page while css is the flesh.</i> That is how important css is!

        In CSS, we have what we call <strong>the box model</strong>, which includes <strong>margin</strong>, <strong>padding</strong>, and <strong>border</strong>. Padding - The inner space between the content and the border of your box. Border - The perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line like the green one pictured above. Margin - The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box.
